# ‚öô  SmartSilo  üå± </h1>

### Description:

With the increase in productivity presented by the grain sector in the country, the need for not only storage places for products, but for them to be optimized to provide greater durability of these products, is of national and strategic interest for the primary economy chain. This project will allow the development of an aeration / drying control system in grain storage silos, with the use of instrumentation in the Internet of Things (IoT) context, with the possibility not only of monitoring but of controlling variables remotely, for maintenance humidity / temperature levels suitable for each type of grain and microclimate conditions inside and outside the silo installation site.
